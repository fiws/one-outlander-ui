## ONE outlander UI theme

![preview](http://i.imgur.com/4dJeKvw.png)

Basically a super simple merge
from [outlander-ui](https://github.com/mthadley/outlander-ui) and [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui).
I just copy pasted variables.

### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to
the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting
it from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.
